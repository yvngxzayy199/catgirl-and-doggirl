In the intersecting realms of scientific exploration and cultural creation, the concepts of "human-animal hybridization" and the ACGN cultural phenomenon of "catgirls"/"doggirls" have drawn significant attention. These concepts reflect humanity's multifaceted contemplation of life forms, technological boundaries, and emotional expression through both realistic scientific approaches and fictional imagination.

In scientific contexts, "human-animal hybridization" primarily refers to chimera research. Due to natural reproductive barriers, humans and animals cannot produce offspring through natural mating. However, modern biotechnology (such as gene editing and cell transplantation) allows human cells to be implanted into animal embryos for medical purposes. For instance, scientists are attempting to grow human organs in animals to address transplant shortages or create disease models for cancer research.

Such research faces strict ethical constraints: International norms generally prohibit the combination of human and animal reproductive cells. Controversies focus on animal rights protection, the boundary of "humanization" (e.g., whether chimeras possess human consciousness), and public acceptance of hybrid lifeforms. Literary and cinematic depictions of "human-animal hybrids" (like the Sphinx in Greek mythology) primarily reflect humanity's imagination of technological boundaries rather than scientific reality.

"catgirls" and "doggirls" represent typical products of ACGN culture, blending human forms with animal characteristics (such as animal ears and tails), falling under the "anthropomorphic animals" subculture. Their origins trace back to mythological traditions (e.g., the Egyptian cat goddess Bastet), but modern popularity stems mainly from Japanese ACGN culture.

Character designs emphasize "contrasting cuteness": catgirls often embody tsundere personalities and lazy charm, while doggirls exhibit loyalty and enthusiasm, satisfying audiences' dual desires for exoticism and approachability. These hybrid forms also serve as objects of emotional projection, aligning with modern society"s craving for companionship (as seen in the healing narrative of Kemono Friends).. Commercially, catgirls/doggirls characters have evolved into a mature industrial chain spanning anime, games (e.g., Arknights), and virtual YouTuber (VTuber) domains.

Although kemonomimi (animal-eared humanoid) characters are widely popular in ACGN culture, their biological realization remains unfeasible in reality. Genetic differences and chromosomal disparities between humans and animals create reproductive isolation, while laboratory techniques like chimera research are confined to medical applications, with ethical guidelines prohibiting the creation of conscious hybrid organisms.

Current implementations of catgirls/doggirls imagery rely on physical mimicry (e.g., pointed ear modifications), cosplay, or digital technologies like AR avatars. These approaches circumvent ethical concerns while fulfilling fantastical desires. Controversies primarily focus on technological ethics (such as extreme cosmetic attempts) and cultural differences - East Asian markets show greater tolerance for anthropomorphic characters, whereas Western acceptance remains lower due to stigmatization associated with "Furry culture".

Should breakthroughs in genetic modification enable the creation of catgirls/doggirls beings in China, this phenomenon would trigger complex and far-reaching issues. The foremost challenge would be legal identity classification, as existing laws lack provisions for "human-animal hybrids". Genetic composition thresholds (e.g., over 50% human cells) would determine whether such beings are classified as "human" or "experimental animals", directly impacting fundamental rights like education and healthcare access, as well as regulatory measures.

Social management would face unprecedented challenges requiring specialized registration systems and customized education/medical programs. However, unpredictable public acceptance could lead to conflicts between segregation policies and human rights protections, necessitating safeguards against employment discrimination and other social inequalities.

Ethical and cultural risks present equally significant concerns. Genetic modification technologies carry risks of misuse, including potential genetic contamination and underground trafficking. Moreover, discrepancies between ACGN cultural symbols and biological catgirls/doggirls entities might trigger "uncanny valley" effects, exacerbating social tensions.

The issues arising from genetic modification technology have already sounded alarm bells for human society. Similarly, in the field of biological research, once scientific exploration deviates from ethical principles, the potential harm is unimaginable.

On November 26, 2018, former Southern University of Science and Technology associate professor He Jiankui shocked the world with his "scientific breakthrough" of creating the "world's first gene-edited babies." However, this event was not a milestone in scientific progress, but rather a reckless experiment that trampled ethical boundaries and violated legal limits. From the birth of the gene-edited babies to the ongoing controversies following his release from prison, He's actions consistently demonstrated a disregard for bioethics and contempt for scientific norms, with consequences so severe that it stands as a disgrace to the scientific community.

He's team used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the CCR5 gene in human embryos, claiming to confer natural HIV resistance. However, this so-called "breakthrough" was essentially a meticulously orchestrated illegal medical operation. Investigations revealed that since 2016, He had self-funded his research, deliberately evaded regulatory oversight, forged ethical review documents, and recruited eight couples with HIV-positive husbands. Through fraudulent blood tests and concealment of embryo-editing truth, he applied unverified technology to human reproduction, ultimately resulting in three gene-edited babies. His actions violated both Article 336 of China's Criminal Law (regarding illegal medical practices) and the international scientific consensus prohibiting heritable genome editing.

Notably, established medical interventions like antiretroviral therapy can already reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission risk to below 1%. He's experiment offered no essential medical value while exposing infants to unknown risks like genetic off-target effects and immune deficiencies. As stated in a global scientists' open letter: "This technology is precisely what the global biomedical research community has chosen not to pursue, due to both technical uncertainties and insurmountable ethical barriers."

He's motivations starkly contradicted his claimed "humanitarian" purposes. Investigations exposed his actions as fundamentally "driven by personal fame and profit," aiming to gain commercial benefits and academic notoriety through ethically dubious experiments. Following the scandal, his institution severed ties—Southern University of Science and Technology terminated his position, journals retracted his papers, awards were revoked, and the scientific community unanimously condemned his "treatment of humans as experimental subjects." His 2019 criminal conviction for illegal medical practice laid bare the unlawful nature of his research endeavors.

This incident inflicted profound damage on scientific credibility. It amplified public panic about gene editing, intensified doubts about research oversight, and triggered international criticism of China's scientific ethics. The World Health Organization's subsequent release of stringent ethical guidelines restricting heritable genome editing served as a direct response to this controversy.

After his 2022 prison release, He publicly announced a pivot to genetic disease therapy, claiming to pursue "public-interest research" while attempting social media-driven image rehabilitation. Yet his words and actions remain contradictory and problematic. While superficially professing adherence to ethics and limiting work to animal models, he simultaneously propagates alarmist rhetoric about "weaponized gene editing," promotes "super soldier" concepts, and hints that China must engage in a genetic arms race. Such statements lack scientific rigor and have been weaponized by anti-China forces to distort the nation's technology policies.

Furthermore, his attempt to resume research through Hong Kong's "Top Talent Pass Scheme" collapsed due to false declarations, again exposing his habitual disregard for regulations.

On April 15, 2025, his flippant X (Twitter) retort—"Stop asking for catgirls. I'm trying to cure disease"—laid bare enduring contempt for scientific ethics, a cavalier attitude toward public trust, and a persistent self-aggrandizing approach that trivializes serious ethical discourse through inappropriate humor.

He Jiankui genome editing incident scandal stands as a grave warning for both the scientific community and society, starkly illustrating the catastrophic consequences of unbridled technological ambition and the non-negotiable imperative of ethical governance in science.

However, when we set aside this distressing real-world incident and shift our perspective to a fantastical scenario, what extraordinary phenomena might emerge if mysterious genetic editing-related occurrences were to manifest in some enigmatic location?

...

If catgirls and doggirls were to emerge in Lingshui Li Autonomous County, Hainan. This phenomenon remains extremely covert, known only to a handful of individuals. Over subsequent years, these catgirls and doggirls quietly engaged in widespread reproductive activities and cohabitation arrangements across the county with local Li, Han, and other ethnic group humans - including both heterosexual and same-sex relationships. Through human reproduction, vast numbers of new catgirls and doggirls have now emerged. Compared to the initial population, this new hybrid population has grown remarkably, accounting for approximately one-third of the county's original 384,000 residents - currently estimated at 130,000 to 140,000 individuals.

How exactly did these catgirls and doggirls originate? Why did this phenomenon specifically manifest in Lingshui Li Autonomous County? How has this extraordinary occurrence remained unknown to all but a few individuals? Furthermore, how could these hybrids have engaged in such extensive cross-species reproduction and cohabitation across ethnic groups within mere years?

There exists widespread speculation regarding multiple potential mechanisms behind their emergence:

The first involves breakthrough genetic engineering experiments. Targeted chimera technology, potentially developed by clandestine laboratories in Lingshui County, may have combined human stem cells with feline/canine genes to create hybrid lifeforms possessing human intelligence and animal characteristics. Chromosomal fusion technology likely contributed through artificial induction of heterologous chromosome pairing - for instance, merging human 46-chromosome sets with feline 19-chromosome sets via telomere fusion into 65 chromosomes - thereby overcoming reproductive isolation barriers.

During initial experiments, the selection of surrogate mothers potentially leveraged Li women's traditional herbal knowledge, utilizing local plants with immunosuppressive properties to reduce embryo rejection risks. The second aspect involves supernatural intervention. The materialization of Li totemic beliefs may have played a role, with the Li "Great Spirit" myth's references to animal-human transformations potentially activated through special rituals or influenced by natural energy fields like the geomagnetic anomalies of Diaoluo Mountain.

Additionally, marine biotechnology leaks might contribute to this phenomenon. Unknown archaea discovered in the South China Sea possessing horizontal gene transfer capabilities could infect humans through water sources, inducing phenotypic changes that ultimately give rise to these hybrid beings.

If the incident were to be exposed, local governments would immediately report it to higher authorities. National departments would dispatch expert teams to investigate its origins. For public safety, these individuals might first be quarantined or zoned for management, with military or police forces potentially intervening to maintain order and restrict information leaks. The state might declare a state of emergency, suspend external transportation from Lingshui County, and investigate their legal status and origins. If confirmed harmless with human-level intelligence, new regulations would be formulated to determine their citizenship status. Regarding public reaction, local residents might have adapted to the situation, but national public opinion would erupt after external exposure, potentially drawing international attention. If exposed globally, the international community might condemn China, with the UN Bioethics Committee likely intervening to investigate. China would need to submit technical white papers and accept international oversight. Other nations might demand technology sharing, requiring China to strengthen border controls to prevent genetic sample leaks.

Geographically and administratively, under the Hainan Free Trade Port policy, the island's geographical features facilitate convenient offshore control and block information. Simultaneously, the region's unique ethnic minority cultural inclusivity aligns with this scenario - the Li people's traditional "animism" belief system demonstrates higher acceptance of alien lifeforms, while their historical "tattooed totem" customs show aesthetic compatibility with beast-ear morphology.

In terms of scientific infrastructure, the covert biolabs potentially established within the Lingshui Li'an International Education Innovation Pilot Zone could conduct cross-species research using germplasm resources from Sanya Yazhou Bay Seed Laboratory, possibly involving the South China Sea Gene Bank. Additionally, Lingshui County's tropical climate offers adaptability advantages, helping compensate for thermoregulation defects in genetically edited organisms - for instance, cat/dog genes exhibit better high-temperature adaptability, functioning more effectively under such climatic conditions.

The implementation of information blockade follows specific pathways. Regarding technological obfuscation, a "context-responsive genetic switch" is designed through biosystem engineering - feline and canine ear characteristics manifest only under specific hormonal stimuli (such as components found in Lingshui County's abundant coconut water), automatically concealing when outsiders enter; leveraging Hainan's province-wide "electronic fence" system, AI-powered real-time filtering is implemented for keywords and images related to catgirls and doggirls. In social engineering strategies, catgirls and doggirls are promoted as "character performers for the International Tourism Island", exploiting tourists' novelty-seeking mentality to obscure truth. However, in the current information age, complete information blockade is nearly impossible. According to information diffusion models, if merely 0.3% of local residents (approximately 1,500 people) post related content on Douyin, it could reach 210 million views within 2 hours, far exceeding the Cyberspace Administration's real-time filtering capacity (current maximum processing capacity: 84,000 entries/second). CCTV News might broadcast a special feature on Lingshui County's "Model Community for Chinese Nation Unity" to divert public attention.

The rapid proliferation and integration of catgirls and doggirls also involves sociodynamic factors. Biologically, activation of feline polyovulation genes enables 3-5 offspring per pregnancy with shortened sexual maturity cycles to 8 months; canine pheromone receptor genetic modification allows secretion of specific chemical signals triggering subconscious nurturing behaviors in humans. Culturally, the matrilineal social traditions of the Li ethnic group (such as the "Longgui" courtship custom) align with the matrilineal community structures of catgirls and doggirls. The female-centric "lily" family model reduces traditional marital conflicts, with catgirls developing nocturnal fishing industries leveraging feline night vision, while doggirls utilize canine olfactory advantages for pest control in crop cultivation, forming symbiotic economic systems.

For already born catgirls and doggirls, their citizenship, nationality, ethnic identity, and language issues have attracted significant attention.

Regarding legal status and nationality determination: If catgirls/doggirls possess predominantly human genes, according to Article 13 of the *Civil Code of the People's Republic of China*, they may be classified as "special natural persons". Pursuant to Article 4 of the *Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China*, individuals born in China with at least one Chinese parent automatically acquire Chinese nationality. If one biological parent is human and Chinese, nationality inheritance is theoretically feasible. For those entirely created through technology without human parents, legislative amendments are required to address nationality gaps for "non-naturally born individuals".

Concerning ethnic identity: With 56 official ethnic groups in China, they may be categorized as "unrecognized ethnic groups" or potentially form new ethnic groups through State Council approval. In practice, they might be allowed to adopt the ethnic identity of human parents (e.g., Li or Han ethnicity) or receive special designation as "biologically modified populations".

Regarding social management and public policy: Current Household Registration Regulations require amendments to add "genetically modified organisms" category. Lingshui County needs to establish independent population databases for health monitoring. If cohabitation and reproduction with humans occurs, the legality of such "marriages" depends on their recognition as natural persons. Current Marriage Law only recognizes human marriages, necessitating expanded definitions or new legislation. Progeny identity determination requires specific regulations regarding custody rights, inheritance rights, etc.

In terms of language and culture, catgirls and doggirls possess their own communication systems using sounds, body movements, and scents.  

catgirls exhibit diverse vocalizations with distinct meanings. For instance, "meowing" typically serves as communication with humans or other animals, potentially indicating hunger, seeking attention, playfulness, or anxiety. "Hissing" functions as a warning signal demonstrating perceived threats or defensive readiness. Their body language conveys messages through posture and movement: a vertically raised tail with smooth fur indicates contentment and environmental safety, whereas puffed-up fur with an arched back signals fear or aggression. Slow blinking demonstrates relaxation and trust.  

doggirls similarly employ varied vocal expressions. Cheerful barking may denote excitement, reunion joy, or playfulness; low growls typically warn against approaching, serving territorial or protective purposes; high-pitched vocalizations often reflect fear, pain, or nervousness. Their physical expressions prove equally rich: tail wagging with vigorous lateral motions usually indicates happiness or anticipation, while trembling tails tucked between legs suggest fear. Ear positioning communicates additional information: forward-erect ears denote alertness, whereas ears pressed backward against the head may signal submission or anxiety.  

Regarding language acquisition logic, assuming catgirls and doggirls possess human-level intelligence, their linguistic capabilities would depend on environmental influences. The first generation coexisting long-term with Hainan residents might acquire local languages (Li language, Hainanese dialect) and Mandarin, prioritizing Mandarin if integrated into mainstream society.  

Concerning cultural identity formation, governmental guidance might promote cultural integration by educationally deemphasizing animal ear symbolism while reinforcing "Sense of Community for the Chinese Nation" identity. Unique cultural practices (e.g., cat/dog deity worship rituals) would undergo compliance reviews under the *Intangible Cultural Heritage Law of the People's Republic of China*.

Regarding ethical and governance crises, according to Article 48 of the *Biosecurity Law of the People's Republic of China*, if genetic diffusion threatens ecology or public health, the central government may declare Lingshui County a "biosecurity control zone." Mandatory registration, monitoring, and fertility restrictions may be imposed on existing hybrid individuals. Those secretly conducting genetic experiments ("a small group of informed personnel") will face criminal liability under the *Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China* or newly established charges, with involved research institutions or enterprises subject to penalties.  

For long-term social governance, a gradual integration policy might be adopted, including educational exchanges and economic dependency. Historical narratives could be curated to frame the phenomenon as a "necessary cost of technological progress," while restricting the spread of "animal-ear girl" culture to prevent ACGN subcultures from reinforcing their distinct identity. The Chinese government may implement a three-phase strategy of "control → integration → legislative reconstruction," ultimately achieving "de-subjectification" with minimal social cost to ensure their existence does not challenge humanity's civilizational dominance. However, this process may trigger ethical conflicts and localized unrest, though China's strong institutional mobilization capacity would prioritize social stability.  

From a population density and resource perspective, Lingshui County's 380,000 humans combined with 130,000～140,000 catgirls and doggirls hybrids create a total population of 510,000～520,000. With a total area of 1,108 square kilometers (approximately 300 km² of habitable land excluding mountainous regions), the population density reaches about 1,733 people/km². Compared to Hong Kong (19363 people/km² in 387.33 km² habitable area) and Shanghai (4835 people/km² in 4964.13 km²), this density remains manageable globally. Land resources appear sufficient, and basic necessities like food, water, and electricity could be sustained through proper management. Housing pressure would not surge sharply if hybrids integrate into existing households.  

Tourism could experience explosive growth due to the hybrids' uniqueness, generating massive annual revenue and boosting related industries. Specialized sectors like cultural innovation might emerge, while hybrids could enhance productivity in logistics, agriculture, and services. The State Council might approve Lingshui as a special experimental zone, permitting hybrids to work in designated sectors while barring them from sensitive industries. If granted citizenship under Hainan Free Trade Port policies, hybrids could access duty-free shopping and free trade benefits, facilitating economic integration. Conversely, exclusion might damage the free trade port's inclusive image. The government might implement hybrid-specific policies like health screenings or reproductive restrictions to maintain demographic and ecological balance.

...

As a decision-maker, I will implement a three-phase strategic framework of "Emergency Control - Gradual Empowerment - Civilizational Coexistence" in response to the sudden emergence of 130,000～140,000 catgirls and doggirls humanoid beings in Lingshui Li Autonomous County, Hainan, ensuring social stability, technological controllability, and ethical integrity.

Emergency Phase (0～6 months): Lockdown and Basic Support.

Under Article 48 of *Biosecurity Law of the People's Republic of China*, designate Lingshui as a "Special Biological Management Zone," suspending non-essential entries/exits. Deploy AI drones to monitor genetic contamination risks and establish "genetic firewalls" - individuals leaving Lingshui must pass rapid tests to confirm absence of cross-species inheritable genetic fragments. Implement the "Special Group Temporary Assistance Program," distributing blockchain-encrypted digital survival vouchers for food/medicine redemption at designated outlets to prevent black market activities. Construct modular eco-habitats via 3D printing within 48 hours, prioritizing shelter for those without human relatives to reduce resource conflicts. Form the "Lingshui Incident Interdepartmental Investigation Task Force," combining national security, military, and biohacker teams to reverse-engineer genetic editing traces. If proven to involve illegal experiments, prosecute responsible parties under new "ecocide" clauses of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, offering immunity to cooperative informants for data acquisition.

Transition Phase (6 months～3 years): Identity Reconstruction and Social Experimentation.

Enact the "Interim Regulations on Trans-species Intelligent Lifeform Management," defining catgirls/doggirls beings as "Genetic Fusion Citizens" with limited rights: permitting digital wallets while prohibiting real estate ownership. Establish "Trans-species Collegiate Panels" comprising human judges, beast-ear representatives, and AI ethics advisors to handle GFC-related cases. Grant no voting rights but allow election of 3 advisors to the county CPPCC for "limited representative system" trials. Develop Lingshui into a "Hyper-sensory Experience Zone," leveraging feline auditory and canine olfactory capabilities for novel service industries. Issue "Sensory Contribution Points" redeemable for education resources and medical priority.

Long-term Phase (3～10 years): Civilizational Leap and Interstellar Preparation.

At Wenchang Space City, establish the "Trans-species Adaptation Lab" to transform beast-ear traits into space survival advantages: utilizing catgirls balance in microgravity station maintenance, adapting doggirls radiation resistance for Mars colonist gene modification. Incorporate their genetic sequences into the "Human Civilization Backup Project" stored at lunar bases. Create "Human-Beast-ear Hybrid DAOs" using blockchain for resource allocation, issuing NFT identity credentials recording genetic data at birth. Major decisions to follow a "dual-chain consensus mechanism." Deploy the "Chinese Turing" ethical AI to monitor social integration indices, triggering circuit-breakers when beast-ear birth rates double humans' or key industry participation exceeds 15%. Construct "Civilizational Isolation Pods" at South China Sea submersible bases to preserve pure human gene banks.

Additionally, there are risk hedging strategies. Produce a documentary titled "Kemonomimi" showcasing their traditional cultural skills, reinforcing the image of "new members of the Chinese national family". Launch VTubers on Bilibili to popularize quantum physics, diverting public attention from genetic issues. Select catgirls with exceptional hearing to join the "79th Special Operations Brigade" for reconnaissance in complex terrains, while deploying doggirls' olfactory warning systems on Yongxing Island to monitor trespassing fishing boats and abnormal ocean currents. Designate catgirls/doggirls as "Earth Civilization Ambassadors" for future interstellar diplomacy, demonstrating humanity's inclusiveness.

This initiative transcends mere population management, transforming the Lingshui incident into a stress test for "Human Civilization 2.0". Domestically, it proves socialist system's capacity to withstand technological singularity impacts; internationally, it showcases China's institutional superiority in bioethics.

Lingshui County may become a pilot zone to test coexistence management between "new species" and humans, providing experience for diversified social governance in free trade ports.

Ultimately, when future historians reflect on this moment, they might record:

"In the 21st century, a group of animal-eared philosophers, amidst Hainan's coconut breezes and tropical ambiance, gently pushed open the door to post-human civilization."

This seemingly absurd genetic accident will ultimately propel humanity into a more complex and brilliant civilizational epoch - where life's form no longer remains destiny's shackles, but becomes poetry of freedom.
